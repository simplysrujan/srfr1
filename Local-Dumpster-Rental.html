Customer’s Duties and Liability. Customer shall be responsible for  the safekeeping of Contractor’s equipment.

Customer shall not overload the equipment, nor use it for incineration purposes. Customer is liable for any loss, damages or costs in excess of reasonable wear and tear or as a result of overloaded equipment, including any over weight ticket that my be issued to Contractor for loads exceeding the current weight limit of ten tons. In the event this law changes, customer shall adhere to the new law on weight limits. Customer understands that Contractor cannot weigh the container prior to removal of the loaded container due to the expense involved and thus the liability of the weight is fully held by the Customer. Customer shall indemnify, defend and hold Contractor harmless from and against all claims and liabilities for injury or death to persons or loss or damage to property arising out of Customer’s use, operations or possession of the equipment. Customer shall keep all information, including but not limited to pricing and terms, in this Agreement confidential as sharing such trade information could cause irreparable harm to Contractor.  Contractor reserves the right to remove (e.g., dump out) materials from its equipment in instances where Contractor determines, in its sole discretion, that its equipment is overloaded, by either weight or volume, or in instances of Customer’s nonpayment.  Customer is solely and exclusively liable for any and all fees, fines, property damage clean-up costs and/or other costs associated with such removal of materials. If Customer’s facility is locked, Customer herby authorizes Contractor, if necessary at Contractor’s discretion, to remove any type of locks by whatever means needed in order to access its equipment at any time<br><br><p><a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/local-pest-control-companies1/Local-Dumpster-Rental.html">dumpster rental</a><br> <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/local-pest-control-companies1/Local-Dumpster-Rental.html">rent dumpsters</a><br> <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/local-pest-control-companies1/Local-Dumpster-Rental.html">All sizes dumpster rental</a><br> <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/local-pest-control-companies1/Local-Dumpster-Rental.html">cheap dumpster rentals</a><br> </p><br></body><br></html>
